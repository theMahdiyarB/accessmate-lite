## üìñ Project Overview

**AccessMate Lite** is a privacy-focused, open-source Chrome extension that helps users quickly understand and listen to web content in their preferred language. At its core, the extension uses state-of-the-art AI from Google Gemini to summarize selected text or entire pages and read the result aloud using high-quality voices. Designed for accessibility and everyday productivity, AccessMate Lite empowers people who prefer listening over reading, who want to digest web content quickly, or who benefit from assistive technologies.

The project is built to be as transparent, lightweight, and user-controlled as possible. All logic runs on the user's device, with no hidden data collection or server dependencies. The only third-party service is the Google Gemini API, which is accessed directly from the browser and requires the user‚Äôs own API key. This not only respects user privacy, but also lets users fully control their own usage and quotas.

## ‚ú® Features

| Capability                   | Details                                                                                                   |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Multilingual summariser**  | Uses **Gemini Flash** to condense the selection (‚â§ 80 words) while preserving the original language.      |
| **Voice output**             | Reads the summary aloud using any Gemini TTS voice‚Äîselectable, live-fetched from the API, with WAV output.|
| **Full page/selection modes**| Summarize and/or read either highlighted text or the whole page, all in one click.                        |
| **Material/Chrome-style UI** | Clean, modern interface with automatic dark/light mode‚Äîno frameworks, pure HTML+CSS.                      |
| **Privacy-first**            | All requests go directly from the browser to Google; no third-party servers or storage.                   |
| **One-file build**           | Only 4 source files ‚Äì `manifest.json`, `popup.html`, `popup.js`, and `settings.html` (+ optional icon).   |
| **Free-tier-friendly**       | Works with Google AI Studio API keys (with Generative Language + Audio scopes).                           |

## üìÇ File-by-File Explanation

- **`manifest.json`**: This is the main configuration file for the Chrome extension. It declares the extension‚Äôs name, version, permissions, entry points (popups and settings), and its compatibility with Manifest V3. Keeping the manifest minimal and well-structured is essential for Chrome Store approval and user trust.

- **`popup.html`**: The user interface shown when clicking the extension icon. It presents four main action buttons‚Äîsummarizing or reading either the selection or the whole page‚Äîalong with a styled output area for results or errors, and a settings gear button. All HTML is designed to be Material/Chrome-like using only CSS.

- **`popup.js`**: Contains all the logic for user interactions in the popup. It detects selected text, communicates with the Gemini API for summaries and TTS, manages the output display, and handles error reporting. It fetches and uses the user‚Äôs saved preferences (like API key and preferred voice/model) to ensure personalized operation.

- **`settings.html`**: A dedicated settings page for entering the Google Gemini API key, choosing the preferred text and TTS models, and picking a voice. The HTML here mirrors Google‚Äôs clean design philosophy and helps make configuration easy, even for non-technical users.

- **`settings.js`**: The brains behind the settings page. It loads/saves options using Chrome's extension storage and calls the Gemini API to fetch the full list of available models and voices, caching these for daily freshness. The script also validates user input and shows helpful feedback.

- **`icon128.png`**: The toolbar icon shown in Chrome‚Äôs extension bar. This file is optional, but provides a professional, recognizable look for the extension.

*Note:* You may also find support files (e.g., `release.sh` and `bump-version.js`) in the repository for automating releases and version bumps. These are used by the developer to ensure each release is tagged, versioned, and zipped correctly.

## üí° Design Choices and Rationale

- **Manifest V3**: By using the latest extension platform, AccessMate Lite benefits from enhanced security, background efficiency (service workers), and better compliance with Google‚Äôs policies. This was chosen even though MV3 introduces stricter permissions and some migration headaches, because it is the only future-proof choice for Chrome extensions.

- **No Frameworks/Build Tools**: All code is written in plain HTML, CSS, and JS for maximum transparency and ease of inspection. This minimizes dependencies and surface area for bugs or vulnerabilities, but required more manual UI work (especially for Material-like styling and dark mode support).

- **Direct-to-API, User-Provided Keys**: Rather than proxying requests through a backend (which would be easier for free-tier limitations or abuse control), we require users to generate and manage their own API keys. This shifts responsibility to the user, but massively increases privacy and keeps running costs zero.

- **Dynamic Model/Voice Fetching**: Instead of hardcoding supported models or voices, the settings page fetches the latest from the Gemini API and caches daily. This means users always have access to new Google features and prevents maintenance drift, at the cost of a slight delay when first loading settings.

- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation, clear focus indicators, and ARIA labels are included wherever possible. The UI‚Äôs color contrast is tuned for both light and dark themes, based on the user‚Äôs system preference.

- **Automated Release Workflow**: Scripts like `release.sh` and `bump-version.js` ensure that main branch releases are consistent, versioned, zipped, and documented in the changelog. This prevents human error, encourages semantic versioning, and keeps release notes consistent.

- **Error Handling**: Instead of silent failures or disruptive popups, all errors (from quota issues to invalid keys) are shown directly in the output area, so the user always knows what went wrong and can recover.
